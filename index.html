In 1930’s while it’s well to do populace moved to cities in search of better prospects, the less privileged remained at the place. Realities such as lack of basic necessities pertaining to transport, health and hygiene exacerbated their condition. Geographic distance from the parish church kept the believers from practicing their faith in the parish community.<br>

                In such circumstances, Fr Denis J D’souza the parish priest of Sacred Heart Church at Madanthyar contacted the Ursuline Franciscan Sisters who were known to him; he requested them to assist in uplifting the people of God. The Superior General Sr. Rose Saldanha agreed to the request; the request accompanied assurance of a residence close to the Church, teaching post in the Parish School and four acres of land. The proposal came into view as Bishop V.R.Fernandes endorsed the proposal and signed the agreement on July 3, 1936. He also instructed the sisters to sign an agreement that spelled out guidelines for mutual expectation along with responsibilities with respect to both spiritual and temporal needs.</p><hr />
